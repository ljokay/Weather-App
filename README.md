Weather Application

Currently uses fetchWeather API from https://open-meteo.com.

User enters the city they want the weather information from.
The program then uses the getCoordinatesMethod(), which makes a call to https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.01/-95.84 and retrieves the coordinates for the city they entered.
This information is then entered into the fetchWeather() function to return the weather details for those coordinates/that city.
Weather information is then displayed to the user.

More advancements to be added in the future.
